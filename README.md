# Konfigurator3000 - web typography and theming tool

Doing typography tests in Figma, XD and the likes is sketchy (_get it?_), and having to go through projects' specs in order to extract the global styles to be applied to your website or app is quite cumbersome and **downright boring**! I was tired of this process and figured a tiny tool like this could help, hope it's useful to you as much as it's for me :smile:

## TODO - features (order of priority)

- A better color editor that allows for changes in the primary and helper colors;
- i18n for multilingual support
- A guide, written in the initial markdown, as to how to use this tool, followed by maybe some tips on typography.
- A misc editor with information on image width, box shadows, etc.
- Previewing the theme with a [regular website structure](http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/) for more real-world feeling other than just a blog post.
- Make it responsive for mobile usage
- Testing

## TODO - usage / nice-to-have

- H1s should have a default margin-top of 0 as they usually come first and don't have to distanciate from a element on top!
